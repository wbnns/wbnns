to create, grow and maintain a successful open source project.

+ [Mastering Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook), Editor: Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos covers
  the technical foundations of bitcoin and other cryptographic currencies, from

### Teaching

+ [Stanford University](https://crypto.stanford.edu/cs251_fall15/cs251p.html), Bitcoin Engineering (CS251P): CS251 tackles the applied
  side of Bitcoin with a focus on practical projects. Students go through a
series of Bitcoin-based labs, each of which are focused on a single practical
problem that they'd encounter while trying to use Bitcoin. Over the course of
going through these labs, students learn how to use Bitcoin mining chips in
conjunction with Bitcoin-based software to build micropayments-based
applications that work with an internet-connected device. The goal of the class
it to help students gain the practical knowledge required to build fairly
sophisticated hardware and software applications that require intimate knowledge
of the Bitcoin protocol.
