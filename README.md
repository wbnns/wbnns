### Books

+ [Learn How to Code](https://howtocode.trek.io/), Editor: Learn How to Code is a free e-book with everything
  a person would need to know to get started or level up as a web developer.

+ [Maintaining Open Source
  Projects](https://books.thoughtbot.com/assets/maintaining-open-source-projects.pdf), Editor: There are many aspects to fostering
  an open source project -- building community, promoting the library,
maintaining good communication, among other factors. This book is a take on how
to create, grow and maintain a successful open source project.

+ [Mastering Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook), Editor: Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos covers
  the technical foundations of bitcoin and other cryptographic currencies, from
cryptography basics, such as keys and addresses, to the data structures, network
protocols and the consensus mechanism ("mining") that underpin bitcoin. Each
technical topic is explained with user stories, analogies and examples, and code
snippets illustrating the key concepts.

+ [Mastering Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook), Editor:  Mastering Ethereum by Andreas Antonopoulos is a
  book for developers, offering a guide to the operation and use of the Ethereum
Open Blockchain.

### Teaching

+ [Stanford University](https://crypto.stanford.edu/cs251_fall15/cs251p.html), Bitcoin Engineering (CS251P): CS251 tackles the applied
  side of Bitcoin with a focus on practical projects. Students go through a
series of Bitcoin-based labs, each of which are focused on a single practical
problem that they'd encounter while trying to use Bitcoin. Over the course of
going through these labs, students learn how to use Bitcoin mining chips in
conjunction with Bitcoin-based software to build micropayments-based
applications that work with an internet-connected device. The goal of the class
it to help students gain the practical knowledge required to build fairly
sophisticated hardware and software applications that require intimate knowledge
of the Bitcoin protocol.
