## Background

### Books

+ [Learn How to Code](https://howtocode.trek.io/), Editor: Learn How to Code is a free e-book with everything
  a person would need to know to get started or level up as a web developer.

+ [Maintaining Open Source
  Projects](https://books.thoughtbot.com/assets/maintaining-open-source-projects.pdf), Editor: There are many aspects to fostering
  an open source project -- building community, promoting the library,
maintaining good communication, among other factors. This book is a take on how
to create, grow and maintain a successful open source project.

+ [Mastering Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook), Editor: Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos covers
  the technical foundations of bitcoin and other cryptographic currencies, from
cryptography basics, such as keys and addresses, to the data structures, network
protocols and the consensus mechanism ("mining") that underpin bitcoin. Each
technical topic is explained with user stories, analogies and examples, and code
snippets illustrating the key concepts.

+ [Mastering Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook), Editor:  Mastering Ethereum by Andreas Antonopoulos is a
  book for developers, offering a guide to the operation and use of the Ethereum
Open Blockchain.

### Teaching

+ [Stanford University](https://crypto.stanford.edu/cs251_fall15/cs251p.html), Bitcoin Engineering (CS251P): CS251 tackles the applied
  side of Bitcoin with a focus on practical projects. Students go through a
series of Bitcoin-based labs, each of which are focused on a single practical
problem that they'd encounter while trying to use Bitcoin. Over the course of
going through these labs, students learn how to use Bitcoin mining chips in
conjunction with Bitcoin-based software to build micropayments-based
applications that work with an internet-connected device. The goal of the class
it to help students gain the practical knowledge required to build fairly
sophisticated hardware and software applications that require intimate knowledge
of the Bitcoin protocol.

### Open Source

+ [Base](https://base.org/): An Ethereum L2, incubated by Coinbase and built on the open-source OP Stack.

+ [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org/): Bitcoin Core is a reference client of bitcoin. Initially, the software was
published by Satoshi Nakamoto under the name Bitcoin, then Bitcoin-Qt and later
renamed to Bitcoin Core. It is also known as the Satoshi client. It is a full
client used by bitcoin nodes that create the bitcoin network. Through the
changes to Bitcoin Core, its developers make changes to the underlying bitcoin
protocol.
 
+ [Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/): Bitcoin.org was originally registered and owned by Satoshi Nakamoto and Martti
Malmi. When Satoshi left the project, he gave ownership of the domain to
additional people, separate from the Bitcoin developers, to spread
responsibility and prevent any one person or group from easily gaining control
over the Bitcoin project. Since then, the site has been developed and maintained
by different members of the Bitcoin community. On GitHub, there have been over
3,200 commits from 180 contributors. Over 950 translators have helped make the
site natively display in 25 different languages. Bitcoin.org receives tens of
millions of visits a year.
 
+ [Congo Developers Club](https://congodevelopers.com/): The Congo Developers Club is an online place where developers across Congo and
Central Africa can exchange ideas, experiences and opportunities in the field of
computer science and personal / professional development.

+ [European Space Agency (ESA)](https://www.esa.int/): The European Space Agency (ESA) is Europe's gateway to space. Its mission is to
shape the development of Europe's space capability and ensure that investment in
space continues to deliver benefits to the citizens of Europe and the world.
 
+ [Fedora Project](https://getfedora.org/): The Fedora Project is a project sponsored by Red Hat primarily to coordinate the
development of the Linux-based Fedora operating system, operating with the
vision that the project creates a world where free culture is welcoming and
widespread, collaboration is commonplace, and people control their content and
devices. The project also oversees Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux.
 
+ [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)](https://jpl.nasa.gov/): The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is a federally funded research and development
center and NASA field center in the City of La CaÃ±ada Flintridge, California,
United States. Founded in the 1930s by Caltech researchers, JPL is owned by NASA
and managed by the nearby California Institute of Technology.

+ [Python](https://python.org/): Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its
design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant
indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports
multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and
functional programming.
 
+ [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/): Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It
supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented,
and functional programming. According to the creator, Ruby was influenced by
Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, Basic, and Lisp.
 
+ [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/): Ruby on Rails, or Rails, is a server-side web application framework written in
Ruby. It is a modelâ€“viewâ€“controller (MVC) framework, providing default
structures for a database, a web service and web pages. It encourages and
facilitates the use of web standards such as JSON or XML for data transfer,
HTML, CSS and JavaScript for user interfacing.
